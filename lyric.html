            How can it be? You and me
            Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
            But I don't wanna cause no scene
            I'm usually so unproblematic
            So independent
            Tell me why
            'Cause the boy is mine, mine

            Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
            Baby, come over, come over (over)
            And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

            The boy is mine
            I can't wait to try him
            Le-let's get intertwined
            The stars, they aligned
            The boy is mine
            Watch me take my time
            I can't believe my mind
            The boy is divine
            Boy is mine

            Please know this ain't what I planned for
            Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
            There's gotta be a reason why
            My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
            Say, "It's fine" (it's fine)
            Happens all the time

            Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
            Baby, come over, come over (over)
            And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

            The boy is mine
            I can't wait to try him
            Le-let's get intertwined
            The stars, they aligned
            The boy is mine
            Watch me take my time
            I can't believe my mind
            The boy is divine
            Boy is

            And I know it's simply meant to be
            And I, I take full accountability for all these years
            Promise you I'm not usually
            Like this, shit, it's like news to me, to me
            But I can't ignore my heart, boy (the boy is mine)

            I can't wait to try him (oh)
            Le-let's get intertwined
            The stars, they aligned
            The boy is mine
            Watch me take my time
            I can't believe my mind
            The boy is divine
            Boy is mine
